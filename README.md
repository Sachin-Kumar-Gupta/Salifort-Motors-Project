# Salifort-Motors-Project

# Overview
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. They refer to you as a data analytics professional and ask you to provide data-driven suggestions based on your understanding of the data. They have the following question: what’s likely to make the employee leave the company?

# Goal
Goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.
If you can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.

# Conclusion

To retain employees, the following are the recommendations to the stakeholders:

1. The number of projects that employees can work on should range from 3 to 4 and maximun 5.
2. Consider promoting employees who have been with the company for atleast four years.
3. Either reward employees for working longer hours, or don't require them to do so.
4. If employees aren't familiar with the company's overtime pay policies, inform them about this. If the expectations around workload and time off aren't explicit, make them clear.
5. Hold company-wide and within-team discussions to understand and address the company work culture, across the board and in specific contexts.
6. High evaluation scores should not be reserved for employees who work 200+ hours per month. Consider a proportionate scale for rewarding employees who contribute more/put in more effort.
